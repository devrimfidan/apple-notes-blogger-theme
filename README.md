# Apple Notes Blogger Theme - Enhanced Edition

## Credits
Based on the original [Apple Notes Blogger Theme](https://github.com/muddassirhq/apple-notes-blogger-theme).

## New Features & Enhancements
We have significantly refined the theme to better mimic the native Apple Notes experience while improving functionality for Blogger users:

### 1. Enhanced UI & Styling
- **Theme Variables:** Implemented fully customizable variables for Backgrounds, Accents, and Typography. You can now change colors directly from the Blogger > Customize panel without touching code.
- **Visual Polish:**
    - Removed link underlines for a cleaner look.
    - Added authentic "Apple Notes Yellow" active states and link colors.
    - Improved selection and focus states for search bars and list items.
    - Aligned headers and window controls for pixel-perfect layout.

### 2. Functional Additions
- **Native Share Button:** Added a functional "Share" button to the toolbar. It uses the native OS share menu on supported devices (mobile/Mac) and falls back to verifying URL copy on others.
- **Dynamic Sidebar Footer:**
    - Replaced hardcoded buttons with a dynamic Link List widget.
    - Footer links (e.g., "My Website | About") can be managed entirely via the Blogger > Layout editor.
    - Links are styled inline with pipe separators, maintaining the minimal aesthetic.

### 3. Layout Fixes
- **Admin Panel Compatibility:** Added structural fixes to ensure widgets stack correctly in the Blogger Layout editor, preventing disjointed sidebar sections.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Improved visibility of Search and Date headers across mobile and desktop views.

## Future Roadmap
We are planning further improvements to make this the ultimate writing theme for Blogger:

- [ ] **Dark Mode Support:** Automatic switching based on system preference.
- [ ] **Folder-like Navigation:** Grouping posts by Label into collapsible "Folders" in the sidebar.
- [ ] **Rich Text Editor Styles:** Better styling for blockquotes, code blocks, and images within posts.
- [ ] **Search Experience:** Instant search results as you type (AJAX).

## Feedback
We would love to hear your thoughts!
